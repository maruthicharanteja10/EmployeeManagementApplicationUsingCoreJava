# Employee Management Console Application

This project is a simple Java console-based Employee Management Application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using an in-memory storage (ArrayList). The application lets you add, search, update, and delete employee records through a menu-driven interface.

## Overview

The application is organized into multiple packages:
- **Entity**: Contains the `Employee` class (a Plain Old Java Object) that represents an employee.
- **service**: Declares the `EmployeeService` interface with the common CRUD operations.
- **serviceimpl**: Implements the `EmployeeService` interface in `EmployeeServiceImpl` using an `ArrayList` to store employee data.
- **app**: Contains the main class (`EmployeeApp`) that drives the console-based menu.

## Features

- **Add Employee:** Input employee details and add a new employee to the list.
- **Get Employee by ID:** Search for and display an employee based on their ID.
- **Get Employee by Salary:** Search for an employee with a specified salary.
- **Update Employee:** Update employee attributes (name, salary, age, designation, or phone number) based on ID.
- **Remove Employee:** Delete an employee record using the employee ID.
- **Display All Employees:** List details of all employees.

## Project Structure

Below is a neat diagram of the project structure:

```plaintext
.
├── Entity
│   └── Employee.java           // Employee POJO with attributes (ename, eid, phoneno, esal, eage, edesgn)
├── service
│   └── EmployeeService.java    // Interface defining CRUD operations
├── serviceimpl
│   └── EmployeeServiceImpl.java// Implementation of EmployeeService using an ArrayList
└── app
    └── EmployeeApp.java        // Main class with the console menu for user interaction

Prerequisites
Java JDK 8 or higher
An IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode) or a command-line environment for compiling and running Java applications
Setup and Running the Application
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EmployeeManagementApp.git
cd EmployeeManagementApp
Compile the Project:

If you are using the command line, navigate to the project root and compile the classes. For example:

bash
Copy
Edit
javac -d bin Entity/Employee.java service/EmployeeService.java serviceimpl/EmployeeServiceImpl.java app/EmployeeApp.java
(Make sure to adjust the classpath separator if you're on Unix-based systems by replacing ; with :.)

Run the Application:

Navigate to the output directory (e.g., bin) and run the main class:

bash
Copy
Edit
java app.EmployeeApp
The console menu will appear. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, search, update, or delete employee records.

Future Enhancements
Persistence: Integrate a database to store employee data persistently.
Input Validation: Add robust input validation to improve reliability.
Enhanced Error Handling: Provide more user-friendly error messages and logging.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI for a more interactive user experience.
